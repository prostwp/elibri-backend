# Demo Bot — read-only HTTP JSON API

The Telegram demo bot exposes the same twelve agents over plain HTTP so the
team can test them without Telegram. The API is a thin JSON layer over the
**exact same card builders** the bot dispatches to — same data sources, same
caches, same honesty rules. It changes nothing about how the bot behaves in
Telegram.

- **Binary**: built into `bin/demobot`; the server starts automatically
  alongside Telegram long polling.
- **Address**: `DEMOBOT_HTTP_ADDR` env var, default `127.0.0.1:8090`.
  A bind failure at startup is fatal (clear log line), so a running bot
  always implies a running API.
- **Shutdown**: same SIGTERM path as the poller — in-flight requests get a
  5-second drain.
- **Methods**: `GET` only. Anything else → `405` with `Allow: GET`.
- **CORS**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on every response — this is a
  public read-only demo, nothing here is sensitive or mutable.
- **Rate limit**: global in-memory token bucket, **10 requests/second**
  across all clients. Over budget → `429` with `Retry-After: 1`.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Params | What it returns |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /` | — | Tiny index pointing at `/agents` |
| `GET /agents` | — | The agent list: name, description, supported assets, example URLs |
| `GET /agents/macro` | — | Risk-on/off regime of big money |
| `GET /agents/whale` | — | Large on-chain BTC transfers, net flow |
| `GET /agents/funding` | — | Perp funding pressure & liquidations |
| `GET /agents/momentum` | `?asset=` optional | RSI/MACD; without `asset` the multi-asset BTC/ETH/XAUUSD card |
| `GET /agents/trend` | `?asset=` optional (default `btc`) | Trend state machine (ADX + EMA50/EMA200) |
| `GET /agents/sr` | `?asset=` optional (default `btc`) | Support/resistance swing clusters |
| `GET /agents/vol` | `?asset=` optional (default `btc`) | ATR(14) expansion/compression check |
| `GET /agents/fx` | — | Forex overview: EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, XAUUSD |
| `GET /agents/news` | — | Narrative radar (48h mention window) + AI idea |
| `GET /agents/risk` | `?balance=&risk=&entry=&stop=` all required | Position-size calculator |
| `GET /agents/digest` | — | All agents in one sweep, prioritized; AI brief in `ai_text`, one-liners in `sections` |
| `GET /agents/top` | — | The single strongest signal right now, with the AI brief + why-line |

**Assets** for `momentum` / `trend` / `sr` / `vol`:
`btc` (default), `eth`, `eurusd`, `gbpusd`, `usdjpy`, `xauusd` — aliases
`xau`, `gold`, `bitcoin` are accepted. Passing `?asset=` to any other agent
is a `400` (those reads are not asset-specific, and pretending otherwise
would be misleading).

`risk` accepts the same tolerant number formats as the Telegram command:
`balance=10,000`, `risk=1%`, `entry=$64000` all parse.

## Response envelope

Every agent endpoint answers with one shape:

```json
{
  "agent": "Trend Agent",
  "asset": "EURUSD",
  "ok": true,
  "reason": null,
  "verdict": "Grey zone — trend forming, not confirmed",
  "semaphore": "neutral",
  "facts": ["EMA50 1.1583 vs EMA200 1.1560 — bullish structure", "..."],
  "levels": {"invalidation": 1.148236},
  "confidence": null,
  "ai_text": null,
  "data_as_of": "2026-08-18T09:00:00Z",
  "disclaimer": "Analytics, not financial advice",
  "card_html": "⚪ <b>Trend Agent</b> · EURUSD\n<b>Grey zone — ...</b>\n• ...\n\n<i>Analytics, not financial advice · AlphaVizor · 2026-08-18 09:00 UTC</i>"
}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | string | Full agent name (`"AlphaVizor Digest"` for the digest) |
| `asset` | string | Asset label; `""` when the read is not asset-specific |
| `ok` | bool | `true` when the agent produced a **real reading**; `false` for every degraded state — see [ok / reason](#machine-readable-status-ok--reason) |
| `reason` | string \| null | `null` when `ok`; otherwise the machine-readable WHY (enum below) — branch on this, never on verdict wording |
| `verdict` | string | The card's headline verdict |
| `semaphore` | string | `bullish` \| `bearish` \| `neutral` — the card's traffic light |
| `facts` | string[] | The card's bullet facts, `[]` when none |
| `levels` | object | **trend / sr / vol only**: raw-precision numeric levels — see [levels](#machine-readable-levels). Absent for other agents and on `ok: false` cards |
| `confidence` | int \| null | 0–100 when the source supplied one, otherwise `null` — never invented |
| `ai_text` | string \| null | Plain-text AI block (mood read / idea / brief / why-line); `null` when AI is disabled or the call failed |
| `sections` | string[] | **digest only**: plain-text one-liners of every other agent (the winner heads the envelope) |
| `data_as_of` | string | RFC3339 UTC; for candle-based agents this is the **close time of the last closed bar used** — the same stamp as the card footer |
| `disclaimer` | string | Always `"Analytics, not financial advice"` |
| `card_html` | string | The exact Telegram HTML message the bot would send (for `digest`/`top`: the full composed message) |

## Machine-readable status: ok / reason

Templates must branch on **why** a value is absent, not on verdict strings.
Every envelope carries the pair; when `ok` is `false`, `reason` is one of:

| `reason` | Served by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `market_closed` | macro | Regime `UNKNOWN` because the tradfin market is closed — no lamps to read |
| `source_offline` | any agent | The source behind the headline reading is unreachable. Usually a `503`; also a `200` on the funding card when rates are dead but the liquidation feed is alive (liq facts still render) |
| `insufficient_history` | momentum, trend, sr, vol | Source alive, but too few **closed** bars for the indicator set (always a `503`) |
| `below_threshold` | news | Narrative radar warming up: the top theme is under 5 mentions/24h (`200`, themes listed without scores), or there are no snapshots yet (`503`) |
| `no_data` | macro, whale | Upstream alive but nothing to read: macro unknown **inside** the open tradfin window; whale feed with no BTC snapshot yet |

For `digest` / `top` the pair (and `levels`) describes the **top signal
card** heading the envelope — with every source dead, the honest macro
fallback yields `ok: false`, `"reason": "source_offline"` inside the 200.

The `503` error body carries the same pair beside the message, so single-agent
degraded states are branchable too:

```json
{"error": "Trend Agent: Insufficient history — no verdict", "ok": false, "reason": "insufficient_history"}
```

## Machine-readable levels

Three agents' readings *are* price levels; their envelopes add a `levels`
object with the raw computed numbers — full float precision, never the
display-rounded strings shown in `facts`:

| Agent | `levels` shape |
|---|---|
| `trend` | `{"invalidation": 63297.4}` — price under which the trend structure is broken (1 ATR under the EMA cluster). Omitted only on a degenerate flat series where no ATR exists |
| `sr` | `{"supports": [{"level": 63775.42, "touches": 9}, …], "resistances": […]}` — strength-sorted raw cluster means; an empty side is `[]` ("we looked, nothing clustered"), never `null` |
| `vol` | `{"expansion_ratio": 1.01}` — ATR(14) over its 30-bar average, unrounded |

`levels` is absent for every other agent and on degraded (`ok: false`)
envelopes.

## Errors

Errors are always `{"error": "..."}` with an honest message:

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| `400` | Bad arguments: unknown asset, `?asset=` on a non-asset agent, missing/non-numeric/invalid risk params |
| `404` | Unknown agent name or path |
| `405` | Non-GET method (`Allow: GET` header set) |
| `429` | Over the 10 req/s global budget (`Retry-After: 1` header set) |
| `503` | Upstream degraded: the agent's data source is offline, history is too short for the indicator set, or the narrative radar has no snapshots yet — the same states the Telegram card reports in words. The body adds `"ok": false` and the machine-readable `"reason"` (`source_offline` \| `insufficient_history` \| `below_threshold`) |

`digest` and `top` never `503`: they aggregate whatever is alive and label
dead parts honestly inside the payload (an offline agent shows as an
`"⚪ … offline"` one-liner), exactly like the Telegram digest.

## Honest notes

- **Data sources**: backend REST (`/api/v1/macro`, `whale-flow`,
  `funding/liquidations`, `narratives`, `market/*`) · Binance spot klines
  and futures premiumIndex (public, no key) · Yahoo Finance chart API for
  FX/gold (`GC=F` is the working gold source; `XAUUSD=X` is dead upstream).
- **No fake numbers, ever.** A dead source is a `503` (single agents) or an
  explicit `offline` line (digest/top). Too little history for an indicator
  says so instead of rendering a confident flat. Weekend FX data carries the
  `⏸ Forex market closed` banner fact and is computed on Friday's close.
- **Closed bars only**: indicator math never uses the still-forming candle,
  so `data_as_of` can legitimately lag wall clock by up to one interval.
- **AI is decoration, not a dependency**: `ai_text` is `null` whenever
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is absent or the LLM call fails — the data fields are
  never blocked by it. The AI brief is memoized for **5 minutes per unique
  market state** in one cache shared with the Telegram path, so hammering
  the HTTP digest does not multiply LLM spend.
- **Shared caches**: candles are cached 60s per symbol across both
  transports; ten HTTP digests and a Telegram `/digest` inside a minute hit
  Binance once per symbol, not eleven times.
- **Not an execution feed**: same disclaimer as every card — analytics, not
  financial advice.
